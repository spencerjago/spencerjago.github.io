Hi Babs, It’s Friday, it’s been a long week and I’m feeling the strain. I would love a nice relaxing weekend but I don’t think it’s going to happen – nor next weekend. We’re doing some frantic decorating at the moment, every room upstairs except the bathroom. At the moment what will be our bedroom has no floor and I spent last week painting it. Dad has his work cut out this weekend laying hardwood down so the carpet fitters can lay carpet on Tuesday. As soon as we have finished that room then we start on what will be your room. We need to get it done before we have a house swop in early April for a week with a family from Brighton. It’s busy!! Dad fell through the floor yesterday too scraping all his leg and we now have a hole in the garage ceiling….

We’re going up to Yorkshire later in the month as it will be the last time we go to Grandma’s house before she moves into Auntie Charlotte’s house. I’m not sure how much you’ll remember of Grandmas house when you’re older. It’s lovely, I’ll miss it. I think it’s all going to get a bit stressful around moving day and I think Grandma has had enough of it all already. One of the reasons we’re sorting our house out is so that we don’t have to move. I have no desire to go through all that at the moment!

We got your first school photo yesterday and it’s absolutely lovely. I shall be ordering a big one to put up on the wall and embarrass you when you’re older. You look so grown up in it. You seem to have loads of friends all over school, including some of the older children that you met in after school club. I have just signed you up for Rainbows which is the club you go to before Brownies. You start on Tuesday. So, your extra curricula activities at the moment are Ballet & Jazz on Saturdays, Rainbows on Tuesdays and swimming lessons on Fridays.

Not to mention the mass of play dates and birthday parties we go to. You have a fabulous social life!

Last bit of news for now, I have managed to get us a 3 week house exchange to a beautiful house in Canada for 3 weeks next summer (2015). It’s stunning, surrounded on 3 sides by water with its own boat jetty and lots of sun decks to relax on and look at the water. I am soooo excited about it! Fingers crossed nothing goes wrong and we get to go..!
