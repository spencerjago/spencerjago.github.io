  <h1>Land Registry Digital Service</h1>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry">Land Registry</a> are working with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">The Government Digital Service (GDS)</a> to build a new digital service. The service will form a part of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> and is currently in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/alpha.html">alpha</a> phase following guidance in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design Manual</a> in order to meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default">Government Digital By Default Service Standard</a>.</p>
  <p>The service is being built in the open, with the <a href="https://github.com/landregistry">code</a> developed as open source, and the <a href="/architecture/">architecture</a> and other documentation published under the open government licence.</p>
</div>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
  The alpha will be a minimal viable product of :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The irreducible core of a digital first Land Registry, from the user interface to the system of record, a single digital service that meets the needs of conveyancers, proprietors, lenders and caseworkers while meeting statutory requirements.</li>
  <li>This means the ability to create, store, find, apply to change and change register entries, while showing how fraud can be designed out and security designed in.</li>
  <li>It will not have every feature, only the minimum required to operate the service end-to-end, but it will be a useable system that we can test with real users and will help guide the services we plan to develop at beta stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This will continue to build a digital culture within Land Registry through the adoption of multidisciplinary agile teams.
</p>

<p>
  The objective is to build a working service prototype. This will be used by selected stakeholders and/or a closed group of end users to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>gain greater understanding of Land Registry services</li>
  <li>test design approach</li>
  <li>test some technologies</li>
  <li>gain shared understanding of the service at a coding and integration level</li>
</ul>
