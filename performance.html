  <h1>Performance</h1>
  <p>The scope and direction of the service and prioratisation of our work during alpha has been guided by a combination of qualitative information gathered by <a href="/userresearch">user research</a> and quantitative information taken from existing Land Registry channels.</p>
  <p>During the beta phase we will be able to use a product such as <a href="http://piwik.org/">PIWIK</a> to enable us to improve the service based on insights gleaned from user behaviour with the service.</p>
